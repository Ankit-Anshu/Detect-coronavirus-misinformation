# Detect coronavirus misinformation

## Introduction
In our modern era where the internet is ubiquitous, everyone relies on various online resources for news. Along with the increase in the use of social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, etc. news spread rapidly among millions of users within a very short span of time.
One of the acute problems that I have come across is the circulation of bogus news articles and in today’s world, spurious news articles can cause panic and mass hysteria. I realized the gravity of this problem and decided to base my project on resolving this issue.

## Problem Statement
To develop a fake news classifier that appropriately classifies a news article on COVID-19 into real news or fake news.

## Work Flow
Before starting with this project, I had to search for datasets that had a list of news articles related to COVID-19. This was a challenge since there are not many datasets out there that record COVID-19 news articles. After scouring the internet for days, I finally found a data set that had news articles related to COVID-19. The only task required now was to clean the data, fit the appropriate machine learning model on it, and assess the model’s performance.

#### Step 1: Checking for missing values.
#### Step 2: Looking for inconsistencies in the “Label” column.
#### Step 3: Combining the Title and Text column.
#### Step 4: Removing punctuation, stopwords from the data and converting it into lowercase.
a) Tokenize
b) Stemming
c) Lemmatisation
#### Step 5: Splitting the data into Training data and Test data.
#### Step 6: Implementing Tf-Idf on X_train and X_test.
## Fitting a machine learning model on the training data and assessing model performance.
#### Step 1: Choose a classification algorithm and fit the model on training data.
#### Step 2: Assess model performance using test data.
#### Step 3: Saving model using(pickle)
